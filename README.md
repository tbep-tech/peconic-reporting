Analysis tools for importing, wrangling, and summarizing indicator data relevant to the Peconic Estuary Partnersip.  

## Installing peptools

Begin by installing the package from [r-universe](https://tbep-tech.r-universe.dev).  The source code is available on the tbep-tech GitHub group web page: <https://github.com/tbep-tech/peptools>. Note that peptools only needs to be installed once, but it needs to be loaded every new R session (i.e., `library(peptools)`).

```{r, eval = F}
install.package('peptools', repos = 'https://tbep-tech.r-universe.dev')
```
